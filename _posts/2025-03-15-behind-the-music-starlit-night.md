*Starlit Night* began as an idea to capture a single, magical moment in time—a stillness that feels both vast and deeply personal. I wanted to paint a picture of the kind of night where the world seems to pause, and the universe opens up above you. The stars, cold and distant, speak to something eternal, yet their light brings a quiet warmth, reminding us of the beauty that connects us all.

> Under the quiet glow of the stars, we find a stillness that speaks—of connection, of wonder, and of the light that exists both above us and within us.

To me, this piece is about reflection. It’s about stepping back from the noise of the world and finding solace in a moment of clarity. It’s the feeling of being alone under the stars, but not lonely—because in that stillness, you can sense the presence of something far greater than yourself. Whether that’s connection, eternity, or simply the wonder of existence, it’s a moment where time seems to fall away, leaving only the infinite expanse of light and thought.

Musically, I sought to evoke that sense of infinite quiet and awe. The instrumentation is delicate but purposeful, with soft strings and ethereal piano creating a sense of space and breath. The melody moves gently, much like the stars themselves—steady, constant, and timeless. As the piece unfolds, it swells slightly, subtly mirroring the way moments of reflection can grow into something more profound, even transcendent.

*Starlit Night* isn’t tied to any one story or tradition. It’s an invitation to the listener to bring their own story, their own memories, to the music. Perhaps it reminds you of a holiday night when you looked out the window and felt a sense of peace. Perhaps it takes you to a moment in your life when you allowed yourself to wonder at the beauty of the sky. Whatever it means to you, my hope is that it leaves you with a sense of quiet joy, a spark of clarity, or simply a moment to pause and breathe.

In a season that can often feel fast-paced and overwhelming, *Starlit Night* is meant to offer a moment of stillness—a reminder that the beauty of the world, and the beauty within ourselves, is always there if we take the time to look.

Thank you for letting this music become a part of your story.
